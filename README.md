# Bachelor-Tools

A small collections of python scripts used to work with `.yaml` files in connection with my Bachelor Thesis.

## Usage

```bash
python3 <path/to/python_script> <path/to/file.yaml>
```

## Scripts

The scripts are all located in the directory [src](src).

1. `count_hcp.py`: Counts the HCPs, only differentiates between tagged and untagged entries.

3. `remove_tagged.py`: Creates new file with only untagged HCPs.
